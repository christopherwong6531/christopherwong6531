Digital cyberspace represents a lucrative environment for various attacks and exploits.
Improvements in computer hardware parallel advancements in the sophistication of cyber attacks.
Along with this, digital cyberspace becomes even more entrenched in industry, infrastructure,
and military practice. And while both the threat of attack and the stakes for security increase drastically,
the technology of detection systems has remained relatively stagnant in the past few decades.
These Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems only recognize threats from an established
database of threats. They fail to detect zero-day attacks which could impart enormous damage considering the 
immense importance of computer connectedness in todayâ€™s society. Thus, traditional Signature-Based 
Intrusion Detection Systems prove inadequate against advancing contemporary cyberattack technology.[1]
In this study, various machine learning models were trained to detect network traffic anomalies on a comprehensive, 
labeled cyber attack dataset in order to determine the effectiveness of an ML-powered traffic classification 
system. Benchmark assessment was used to compare the accuracy of each model with each other
- as training data & conditions are kept constant, the most accurate model can be determined.
Throughout the study, the immense computational resources and time required to train models on
such complex data structures proved to be a formidable challenge. Scaling, imputing, and 
preprocessing data were also difficult to nail. While live capture predictions proved too much of 
a challenge, significant results in accuracy assessment were obtained during training using a 80/20 
testing system to deter overfitting. This showed impressive results, with the Neural Net model
scoring the highest at 0.9662 accuracy. The next step would be to implement the trained models in a live capture setting.
