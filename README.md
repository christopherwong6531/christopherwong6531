## Hi, My Name is Christopher

I'm in High School and currently applying to college. Right now, I'm focused on Network Cybersecurity and also Machine Learning in cybersecurity fields.

During my internship at Calpoly Pomona in California, I conducted research on machine learning models in classifying traffic data.
