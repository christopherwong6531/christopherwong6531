## Hi, My Name is Christopher

I'm in High School and currently applying to college.

Right now, I'm focused on Network Cybersecurity and also Machine Learning in cybersecurity fields. I'm a part of AFA Cyberpatriots and compete in local and state CTFs. I am also an intern at Calpoly Pomona focused on research and development.

As a part of my internship I've undertaken a research project and completed a literature review, a paper, and presentation poster on my findings. I presented my findings to a panel of judges during two research competetions, along with answering questions.
