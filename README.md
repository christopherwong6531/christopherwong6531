## Hi, My Name is Christopher

I'm in High School and currently applying to college.

Right now, I'm focused on Network Cybersecurity and also Machine Learning in cybersecurity fields. I'm a part of AFA Cyberpatriots and compete in local and state CTFs. I am also an intern at Calpoly Pomona focused on research and development.
